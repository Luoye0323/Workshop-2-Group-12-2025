So if the user want to add new equipment, the user can add through a specific adding equipment page or directly on the masterfile (through Google Spreadsheet) and it will be automatically added to the database.

For the pptx, the system should read through the masterfile and do the find and replace mechanism based on the tag given in the pptx. The tag should be in the format of {{TAG_NAME}}. The system should also be able to handle the case where the tag is not found in the masterfile.
